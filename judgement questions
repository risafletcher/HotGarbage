Theme/Idea:
How relevant is your project to our Sustainable Futures theme?

Have you articulated a problem statement and clearly shown a plan to addressing it? 
- Composting is very beneficial but many people don't realize that there are ideal circumstances under which the magic of composting happens, or they cannot take the extra time needed to tend to their compost pile.
- **Hot Garbage** is a device that helps take some of the work out of composting!
- It automatically detects the presence of methane, which, in addition to being a potent greenhouse gas, is a sign that your compost pile is not properly aerated and is lacking oxygen.
- In addition to oxygen level, it is also important for the compost pile to remain within an ideal temperature range. Composting happens best at temperatures between 49 C and 65 C. If it's too cold the composting reactions won't happen, and if it's too hot the bacteria working to compost won't be able to survive.
- When **Hot Garbage** detects one or more of the following:
  * an elevated methane level, indicative of too little oxygen
  * a temperature above 65 C
it will take the following actions:
  * display a red light indicating the conditions for composting are not suitable
  * sends an email and an SMS to the user to notify them that their compost pile requests their attention
  * engages a motor that can be connected to the compost drum to automatically stir or flip the pile
 - Has a dashboard to allow the user to remotely monitor the temperature, humidity, and methane levels of the compost pile.

How can you expand on what they built this weekend? What is the future vision of this project? 
- Once the motor control is connected to a heavy-duty motor connected to the compost drum, it will automatically aerate the pile for you.
- **Hot Garbage** can be improved with a durable housing for the sensors so they can be placed right in the compost pile and remain durable.
- It can also be expanded with a water or irrigation control valve which automatically opens to add water to the compost pile when the humidity drops below an ideal level.

Did you design the experience? Did you develop a logo or visual style?

Use of IoT Hardware:
How did you leverage the IoT hardware to solve your problem? 
- Gas sensor to sense methane
- Temperature and humidity sensor to sense proper compost temperature and humidity
- Output LEDs to show status
- Servo to demonstrate stirring ability

Did you make creative hardware substitutions when you lacked the exact part you needed? 
- Butane lighter to simulate methane produced by a bad compost pile.
- Hair dryer to simulate the heat produced by a compost pile.

Did you bring in additional hardware beside what was provided? 
(Explain how you've expanded on what was provided)

Usability/Accessibility:
Have you considered how users will interact with/find value in their product? 
Did you implement a user interface (front-end, external design, etc)?
