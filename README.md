# Optimal Conditions Compost Monitor
### By team #1 HotGarbage

When composting optimal conditions must be maintained in order to prevent production of Methane and other volitile compounds which will increase carbon emmions 

In addition to carbon sequestration composting also supports sustainablility through:
* improved soil health
* reduced soil loss
* increased water infiltration
* increased water storage
